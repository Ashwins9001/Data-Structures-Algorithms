Layout a grid contained in 1D array, with each element
containing characters, apply Draw(x,y) to make it.
Reference an element via y * screenWidth() + x
(for some element at column x, row y),
screenWidth() is integer amt of elements across.
Each char is UNICODE, 16-bit encoding
Workflow:
1. Define characters then pixel size construct console
2. Create/load resources, thread to run engine which calls onUserCreate()
3. Enter game loop which updates timing information (fElapsedTime), length of previous frame
Game loop must be adjusted for varying CPU loads which can lead to change in framerate
either due to updating more or less. Consider formula D = VT, here fElapsedTime (T) constant,
distance travelled is also maintained, thus if CPU load changes then V is affected.
4. Update input - checks user input, filling array m_keys[].bReleased().. and ref via virtual keys.
5. Call onUserUpdate(fElapsedTime) -> update game state and screen, if returns true it goes back to game loop
